# air-bnb-homepage

This is a concept that was originally designed by Matt Wojta≈õ on [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6229203--41-Shots-for-Practice/attachments).

A few things that stuck out to me in this design was the custom placeholder on the input. I've never masked anything other than a single color for an input. With this design, I decided to overlay an element to 'fake' a placeholder to achieve the design constraints.
